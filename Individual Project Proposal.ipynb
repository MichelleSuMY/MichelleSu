    "# Individual Project Proposal\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "# Proposal 1\n",
    "### Research Question\n",
    "\n",
    "Does tendency toward altruism correlate with increased loneliness in students?\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "### Variables\n",
    "#### Independent Variable\n",
    "Altruism will be measured by the \"PSYCH_big_five_inventory_helpful\" variable, representing the degree of agreement with the statement, \"I see myself as someone who is helpful and not selfish with others\". This measure represents altruism as it reflects students' tendency to consider others' needs.\n",
    "#### Dependent Variable\n",
    "Loneliness will be measured by the \"LONELY_dejong_emotional_social_loneliness_scale_emptiness\" variable, representing the degree of agreement with the statement, \"I experience a general sense of emptiness\", which serves as a loneliness indicator.\n",
    "#### Other Variables\n",
    "Student status will be filtered using the \"DEMO_student\" variable to ensure only student responses are included.\n",
    "#### Visualizations\n",
    "Each variable will be visualized using histograms to show the distribution of responses, and a scatter plot will visualize the relationship between altruism and loneliness, helping to identify any trends or patterns.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Bootstrapping will be used to simulate population parameters due to a small sample size. Then, a correlation test will be conducted to analyze the relationship between altruism and loneliness. Following this, a hypothesis test will be performed to examine whether altruistic tendencies affect loneliness levels. Simple linear regression will also be applied to assess the trend between altruism and loneliness, with assumptions such as linearity and independence evaluated.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis\n",
    "Students who score higher on altruism measures are less likely to feel lonely. If we reject the null hypothesis, this will indicate a significant relationship between altruism and loneliness. The simple linear regression results will illustrate the trend and strength of this relationship, providing insights into the psychological impacts of altruistic behavior on student well-being.\n",
    "<br><br><br><br>\n",

    "# Proposal 2\n",
    "### Research Question\n",
    "\n",
    "Are students with learning disabilities more likely to seek help from colleages than students without learning disabilities?\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables\n",
    "#### Independent Variable\n",
    "The presence of learning disability in students will be measured by the \"DEMO_disability_learning\" variable, which is binary (students with or without learning disabilities).\n",
    "#### Dependent Variable\n",
    "The tendency to seek help from colleagues will be measured by the \"SOCIAL_ask_help_colleague\" variable, which uses an ordinal scale to indicate the likelihood of asking colleagues for help when needed.\n",
    "#### Other Variables\n",
    "Student status will be filtered using the \"DEMO_student\" variable to ensure only student responses are included.\n",
    "#### Visualizations\n",
    "The distribution of responses to the dependent variable will be visualized with a histogram to understand the overall trend in help-seeking behaviors. A box plot or violin plot will compare help-seeking tendencies between students with and without learning disabilities, providing insights into central tendency and variability across groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "Bootstrapping will be used to estimate population parameters due to limited sample size. An independent samples t-test or Mann-Whitney U test will be performed to compare help-seeking behaviors between students with and without learning disabilities, as these are appropriate for binary and ordinal data comparisons. Then, logistic regression may be applied to model the likelihood of seeking help based on learning disability status, offering insights into whether learning disabilities increase the odds of asking for help. Assumptions of normality (for the t-test) and independence will be evaluated as appropriate.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis\n",
    "Students with learning disabilities are statistically more likely to seek help from colleagues than students without learning disabilities. If we reject the null hypothesis, this suggests a significant relationship between learning disabilities and help-seeking behavior, potentially indicating a unique need for social support among students with learning disabilities.\n",
    "<br><br><br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "# Proposal 3\n",
    "### Research Question\n",
    "\n",
    "Are students limited by depression less likely to be cooperative?\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables\n",
    "#### Independent Variable\n",
    "Depression Limitations will be measured by \"WELLNESS_depression_limited,\" which uses an ordinal scale to indicate how much depression limits a studentâ€™s activities.\n",
    "#### Dependent Variable\n",
    "Cooperation will be measured by \"PSYCH_big_five_inventory_cooperate,\" an ordinal scale reflecting the tendency to be cooperative.\n",
    "#### Other Variables\n",
    "Student status will be filtered using the \"DEMO_student\" variable to ensure only student responses are included.\n",
    "#### Visualizations\n",
    "A histogram will be used to show the distribution of cooperation levels as it is suitable for visualizing ordinal data. A box plot or violin plot will compare levels of cooperation across varying degrees of depression limitations, providing insights into central tendencies and variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "Bootstrapping will be performed to simulate population parameters due to the limited sample size. A Spearman's rank correlation test will be done to assess the relationship between depression limitations and cooperation, as it is suitable for ordinal data. Then, a hypothesis test will be conducted to determine if the extent of depression limitations significantly impacts cooperative tendencies. Additionally, ordinal logistic regression will be used to model the likelihood of cooperation based on the degree of depression limitations. Assumptions of normality (for any parametric tests) and independence will be evaluated as appropriate.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis\n",
    "Students whose activities are significantly limited by depression are less likely to demonstrate cooperative behaviors. If we reject the null hypothesis, this would indicate a significant relationship between the extent of depression limitations and cooperation, potentially highlighting unique social support needs for students experiencing depression."
